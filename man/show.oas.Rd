\title{
Function to display list of available orthogonal arrays
}
\description{
This function allows to inspect the list of available orthogonal arrays, 
optionally specifying selection criteria
}
\usage{
show.oas(name = "all", nruns = "all", nlevels = "all", factors = "all", 
    regular = "all", GRgt3 = c("all", "tot", "ind"), Rgt3 = FALSE, show = 10, 
    parents.only = FALSE, showGRs = FALSE, showmetrics = FALSE, digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
  \item{name}{
    character string or vector of character strings giving name(s) of (an) orthogonal 
    array(s); results in an error if name does not contain any valid name; 
    warns if name contains any invalid name
}
  \item{nruns}{
    the requested number of runs or a 2-element vector 
    with a minimum and maximum for the number of runs 
}
  \item{nlevels}{
    a vector of requested numbers of levels for a set of factors in question, 
    must contain integers > 1 only;\cr
    nlevels cannot be specified together with factors
}
  \item{factors}{
    a list with the two elements \code{nlevels} and \code{number}, which are both integer 
    vectors of equal length;\cr 
    \code{nlevels} contains the number of levels and \code{number} the number of factors 
    for the corresponding number of levels
}
  \item{regular}{
    either unrestricted (the default \dQuote{all}), a logical which requests 
    (\code{TRUE}) or rejects (\code{FALSE}) regular arrays, or the character string 
    \dQuote{strict} to request strictly regular arrays, for which all confounded factors 
    are \emph{completely} confounded with a 2-factor interaction of two other factors (the 
    latter are fixed level arrays or crossed arrays) 
}
  \item{GRgt3}{
    either unrestricted (the default \dQuote{all}), or a character string which requests 
    \code{GR} (\code{"tot"}) or \code{GRind} (\code{"ind"}) to be larger than 3\cr 
}
  \item{Rgt3}{
    logical requesting inclusion of standard resolution 3 arrays as listed in 
    \code{\link{oacat}} per default, and restricting the output to arrays of 
    resolution at least IV (as listed in \code{\link{oacat3}}), 
    if changed to \code{TRUE}\cr 
}
  \item{show}{
    an integer number specifying how many arrays are to be listed (upper bound), 
    or the character string \code{"all"} for showing all arrays, no matter how many. 
    The default is to show 10 arrays. \code{show = 0} switches off the display of the result 
    and only returns a value. Since August 2018, the number refers to stronger and weaker arrays, separately.
}
  \item{parents.only}{
    logical specifying whether to show only parent arrays or child arrays as well; 
    the default is \code{FALSE} for inclusion of child arrays
}
  \item{showGRs}{
    logical specifying whether to show the generalized resolution quality metrics 
    with the resulting arrays; the default is \code{FALSE}. If set to \code{TRUE}, 
    three metrics are displayed (see Details section).
}
  \item{showmetrics}{
    logical specifying whether to show all array quality metrics with the resulting 
    arrays; the default is \code{FALSE}. If set to \code{TRUE}, several metrics 
    are displayed (see Details section).
}
  \item{digits}{
    integer number of significant digits to show for GR and A metrics;
    irrelevant, if \code{showmetrics} is \code{FALSE}
  }
}
\details{
   The function shows the arrays that are listed in the data frames \code{\link{oacat}}
   or \code{\link{oacat3}}. 

   For child arrays that have to be generated with a lineage rule 
   (can be automatically done with function \code{\link{oa.design}}), the lineage is displayed 
   together with the array name. The option \code{parent.only = TRUE} 
   suppresses printing and output of child arrays. The structure of the lineage entry 
   is documented under \code{\link{oacat}}.
   
   If display of metrics is requested with \code{showmetrics=TRUE}, the printed output shows the metrics
   GR*, GRind*, regular (logical, whether regular or not), SCones* (number of squared canonical correlations that are 1), 
   and the numbers of words of lengths 3 to 8 (A3 to A8). \code{showGRs=TRUE} 
   requests the metrics marked with asterisks only (without \code{SCones} in case \code{GRgt3="ind"}). More information on 
   all these metrics can be found \code{\link[=generalized.word.length]{here}}
}
\value{
   A data frame with the three columns \code{name}, \code{nruns} and \code{lineage}, 
   containing the array name, the number of runs and - if applicable - the lineage for generating the array
   from other arrays. The lineage entry is empty for parent arrays that are either directly available 
   in the package and can be accessed by giving their name (e.g. \code{L18.3.6.6.1}) or are full factorials 
   (e.g. \code{L28.4.1.7.1}). If further information has been requested (e.g. with \code{showmetrics=TRUE}), 
   the data frame contains additional columns.
   
   If no array has been found, the returned value is \code{NULL}.
