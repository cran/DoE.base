\title{
Function to Calculate a Lower Bound for A_R and Internal Auxiliary Functions
}
\description{
The functions serve the calculation of lower bounds for the worst case confounding. lowerbound_AR is intended for direct use, lowerbounds and lowerbound_chi2 are internal functions.
}
\usage{
lowerbound_AR(nruns, nlevels, R, crit = "total")
lowerbounds(nruns, nlevels, R)
lowerbound_chi2(nruns, nlevels)
}
\arguments{
  \item{nruns}{
positive integer, the number of runs
}
  \item{nlevels}{
vector of positive integers, the numbers of levels for the factors
}
  \item{R}{
positive integer, the resolution of the design
}
  \item{crit}{
\code{"total"} or \code{"worst"}; if \code{"total"},
a bound for the overall A_R (sum of the results from \code{lowerbounds}) is calculated;
otherwise, a bound for the largest individual contribution from an R factor set is calculated}
}
\details{
Function \code{lowerbounds} provides (integral) bounds on \eqn{n^2 A_R} (with \eqn{n}=\code{nruns}) according to Groemping and Xu (2014) Theorem 5 for all R factor sets. If the number of runs permits a design with resolution larger than R, the value(s) will be 0. For resolution at least III, the result of function \code{lowerbound_AR} is the sum (\code{crit="total"}) or maximum (\code{crit="worst"}) of these individual bounds, divided by the square of the number of runs.

For resolution II and \code{crit="total"}, function \code{lowerbound_chi2} implements the lower bound \emph{B} on chi^2 which was provided in Lemma 2 of Liu and Lin (2009). For supersaturated resolution II designs, this bound is is usually sharper than the one obtained on the basis of Gr√∂mping and Xu (2014). Due to the relation between \eqn{A_2} and \eqn{\chi^2}{chi^2} that is stated in Groemping (2017) (summands of \eqn{A_2} are an \emph{n}th of a \eqn{\chi^2}{chi^2}, with \eqn{n}=\code{nruns}), this bound can be easily transformed into a bound for \eqn{A_2}; this relation is also used to slightly sharpen the bound \emph{B} itself: \eqn{n^2 \cdot A_2}{n^2 A_2} must be integral, which implies that \emph{B} can be replaced by \code{ceiling(nruns*B)/nruns}, which is applied in function \code{lowerbound_chi2}. Function \code{lowerbound_AR} increases the lower bound on \eqn{A_2} accordingly, if \code{lowerbound_chi2} provides a sharper bound than the sum of the elements returned by functioni \code{lowerbounds}.
}
\value{
\code{lowerbound_AR} returns a lower bound for the number of words of length \code{R} (either total or worst case), \cr
\code{lowerbounds} returns a vector of lower bounds for individual \code{R} factor sets on a different scale (division by \code{nruns^2} needed for transforming this into the contributions to words of length R),\cr
and function \code{lowerbound_chi2} returns a lower bound on the \eqn{\chi^2}{chi^2} value which can be used as a quality criterion for supersaturated designs.
